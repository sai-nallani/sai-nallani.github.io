At [Euler Circle](https://eulercircle.com/), I wrote two expository papers. The first one was on measure theory
and the Radon--Nikodym theorem and the second one was about the universality of Konane in combinatorial game theory.

Measure theory is the study of areas, lengths, and volumes. The subject started when mathematicians were trying
to define a way to assign lengths, areas, and volumes to sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This paper builds up measure theory
to finally prove and explain the *Radonâ€“Nikodym* theorem. You can find it <a href="/mt-paper.pdf">here</a>.

Combinatorial game theory studies games where there is perfect information (therefore no randomness). Such games 
include nim and chess. A game called Konane is special because it was proven to be *universal* (Carvalho and Pereira dos Santos 2017). Learn about it more <a href="/cgt-paper.pdf">here</a>.
